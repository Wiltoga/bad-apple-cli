## Bad Apple CLI

Just my version of this masterpiece in a terminal, since I couldn't find any that matched my expectations (all the other versions I found are in a ugly ASCII style).

### Usage

Just call `bad-apple` in the command line :
```bash
> ./bad-apple.exe
```

### Features

- Use of Unicode characters to fill the screen with square like pixels : `▀▄█`.
- Auto-scale to the console size, and readapts if resized during animation.
- Can change the fps limit, for some reason.
